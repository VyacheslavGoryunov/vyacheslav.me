Back in 2018 my small team and I had created Android application to manage your tasks, goals and ideas. It was the beatiful app with an amazing design and really helpful features. Every week a user could receive a short article about some famous person. That article was written by our permanent author (yes we had own "editorial office"). And people really loved this feature. 

But also the project was helpful for me and my team. It was my first serious experiency in management and for my partner it was a very beginning in programming. 

Uner the hood of the project we used the next stack:
- Xamarin to make an Android application on C#
- Firebase Cloud Messaging to send pushes 
- Laravel as a backend
- A little portion of NodeJS for some websocket features (in the late of project we had implement a chat)

Unfortunately you can't download BrainyPlan now. But you can still watch a site! Just go to [https://brainyplan.com/](https://brainyplan.com/)
